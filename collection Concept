Collection Interface -
-> If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collectuion.
-> In  general collection interface is considered as root interface of collection framework.
-> Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any collection object.
-> general methods are - add(Object O)
                       - addAll(Collection C)
                       - remove(Object O)
                       - removeAll(Collection C)
                       - clear()
                       - retainAll(Collection C)
                       - isEmpty()
                       - size()
                       - contains(Object O)
                       - containsAll(Collection c)
                       - toArray()
                       - iterator()

-> Collection interface doesn't contain any method to retrieve objects there is no concrete class which implements collection class directly.
