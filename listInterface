List Interface -> child interface of collection 

when go for list - need duplicates and insertion order preserved 

index is used to differentiate between two duplicate objects
insertion order preserved by placing 1st element at index 0 , 2nd at index 1 similarly insertion order can  be  preserved.

methods available in List->  all collection methods 
                         -> add(int index, Oject O )
                         -> addAll(int index, Collection c)
                         -> remove(int index)
                         -> indexOf( "A")
                         -> lastIndexOf("A") 
                         -> get(int Index)
                         -> set(int index,Object new )
                         -> ListIterator listIterator()
